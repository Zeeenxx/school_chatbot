# Add Your School Logo - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **Quick Steps:**

1. **Get your logo ready:**
   - Save as PNG format
   - Square dimensions work best (200x200px or larger)
   - Name it one of these: `osmena-colleges-logo.png`, `school-logo.png`, or `logo.png`

2. **Copy to the right location:**
   ```
   Copy your PNG file to: C:\school_chatbot\frontend\public\assets\
   ```

3. **That's it!** The chatbot will automatically use your logo

## 📂 **Exact File Path:**
```
C:\school_chatbot\
└── frontend\
    └── public\
        └── assets\
            └── osmena-colleges-logo.png  ← Your logo goes here
```

## 🔄 **How It Works:**
The chatbot will automatically try these files in order:
1. `osmena-colleges-logo.png` (preferred)
2. `school-logo.png` (alternative)
3. `logo.png` (backup)
4. If none found, shows the "OC" placeholder

## 🎨 **Logo Recommendations:**
