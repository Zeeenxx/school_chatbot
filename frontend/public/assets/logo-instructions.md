# How to Add Your School Logo (PNG File)

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Prepare Your Logo File
- Name your logo file: `osmena-colleges-logo.png`
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format works best)
- Make sure it's a clear, high-quality PNG file

### 2. Add the Logo to Your Project
- Copy your `osmena-colleges-logo.png` file
- Place it in this folder: `C:\school_chatbot\frontend\public\assets\`
- The final path should be: `C:\school_chatbot\frontend\public\assets\osmena-colleges-logo.png`

### 3. The Code Will Automatically Update
Once you place the file, the chatbot will use your actual school logo instead of the placeholder.

## File Location:
```
C:\school_chatbot\
└── frontend\
    └── public\
        └── assets\
            └── osmena-colleges-logo.png  ← Place your logo here
```

## Alternative Names Supported:
- osmena-colleges-logo.png
- school-logo.png
- logo.png

Just make sure it's in the `assets` folder!
